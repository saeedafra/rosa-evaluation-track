# Assignment
`example_1.cpp` is a quick example on a very basic use of arrays. Nothing complicated. This example together with some of the previous examples must be a good starting point to solve this assignment.

# Problem statement
Write a C++ program that gets a list of integers from the user. The user first enters the length of the list similar to `example_1.cpp`. Then the program prints the odd and even numbers separately. Here is an example output:
    
    How many numbers? 5
    Number 1: 3
    Number 2: 4
    Number 3: 1
    Number 4: 18
    Number 5: 0

    Even numbers: 4 18 0
    Odd numbers: 3 1

You must use `even_odd_lists.cpp` as the file name and save it in this folder.
