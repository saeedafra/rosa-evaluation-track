# What is ROSA evaluation track? 
Interested students can freely join the track, where they'll be asked to do a number of assignments. By doing so, we can make sure they have the minimum necessary skills required in the project. Once the track is successfully done, students can apply for a job position in ROSA project. 

# Assignments
There is a series of assignments with a specific order:
* Each assignment covers a certain topic.
* For each assignment, we provide examples together with the assignment problem statement. Understanding the examples is important for solving the problem.
* Each assignment assumes that you know the previous assignments and are comfortable with them.
* Please follow the order specified in [recommended_order.csv](recommended_order.csv).
* We cannot provide any training. The example will help you a lot, but you'll have to do your own self-study.
* Feel free to work on the assignment in a group. But every student must write the solution and submit it individually.

# How to submit assignments
The following instruction assumes that you know what Git and Github are.

1. The main branch of this repository always contains examples, templates and necessary files. There is a folder for each assignment.
2. We will create a personal branch `candidate/<your-name>/main` for you.
3. This branch is protected, meaning that you can't directly push to it.
4. For submitting an assignment,
    1. you must always create a branch `candidate/<your-name>/<desired-branch-name>`
    2. then push your solution and changes to this branch
    3. Once ready, make a Pull Request (PR).
5. Once you submit an PR, reviewers will get back to you with comments if necessary.
6. The assignment is passed once your MR is approved and merged into `candidate/<your-name>/main`.

# Requirements
There are certain rules about how you pass an assignment, how much time you have, etc. Here are the requirements:

1. You have 90 days to pass all assignments from the time you receive the invitation email to the repository.
2. You pass an assignment ONLY when the related Merge Request is approved.
3. Your coding style matters. Clean, readable, well-commented code is important.
4. You should be proactive and independent. Keep in mind that the problem statements of assignments might be incomplete or even wrong. 
5. Learning how to use Git and Github are among the goals of this track. So in addition to C++ or MATLAB assignments, good use of git matters as well.
